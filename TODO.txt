For MONO:
Shaped windows with transparent key is not working. Need to test with alpha PNGs.
System.Management is not available should generate hardware key in another way.
Using #if __MonoCS__ allow us to know when compiled with Mono.
System.Environment.OSVersion.Platform does return "Unix" in both Mac OS X and Linux.
Visual Studio Designer will fuck off anything put on its code so check for Mono in form initializations.

For 1.0:
Some French translation errores will be corrected.
Possible will be translated to German.
